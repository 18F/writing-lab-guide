## The Writing Lab Guide

This repo is a guide to 18F's internal Writing Lab for submitters and editors. You can learn more about the Writing Lab [in this blog post](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/01/22/18f-writing-lab/) or below. This guide is maintained by [18F's Content Guild](https://github.com/18F/g-content).  

The Writing Lab is a virtual writing center where you can get
personalized help from members of the 18F editorial team, which includes
members of the Content Guild, the Experience Design Content Team, and
the Outreach Team. We’re here to provide short-term, ad-hoc writing and
editing help for anything you need.

### What we do

We offer four types of help:

-   Generative — help coming up with and fleshing out ideas for a piece of writing.
-   Developmental — help structuring and planning a piece of writing.
-   Stylistic — help shifting the voice and tone of a piece you’ve already written.
-   Copy editing — help copy editing your finished piece of writing.

We’re ready to help with any kind of written content including emails,
site copy, guides, presentations, talking points, blog posts, and more.
