title: The Writing Lab
---

The Writing Lab is a virtual writing center where you can get
personalized help from members of the 18F editorial team, which includes
members of the Content Guild, the Experience Design Content Team, and
the Outreach Team. We’re here to provide short-term, ad-hoc writing and
editing help for anything you need.

What we do
----------

We offer four types of help:

-   Generative — help coming up with and fleshing out ideas for a piece of writing.
-   Developmental — help structuring and planning a piece of writing.
-   Stylistic — help shifting the voice and tone of a piece you’ve already written.
-   Copy editing — help copy editing your finished piece of writing.

We’re ready to help with any kind of written content including emails,
site copy, guides, presentations, talking points, blog posts, and more.

What we don’t do
----------------

The Writing Lab is designed for short engagements. If you need more than
10 hours of content help, contact Russ Unger about getting a content
designer assigned to your project.

Our role is limited to improving the overall quality of content — its
readability, flow, voice, and tone — and doesn't include approving it
for publication. After a piece of writing has passed through the Writing
Lab, it will be polished and will follow [18F’s Content
Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/), but that doesn’t
necessarily mean it’s ready to be published. Obtaining necessary
approvals, designing a place for the content to live, and completing the
technical work of posting content are all responsibilities of the
content owner.
