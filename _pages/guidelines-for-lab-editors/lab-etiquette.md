title: Lab etiquette — be your best self!
---

We at the Lab pride ourselves on providing our teammates with timely,
personalized help. To do this, it’s important that we accurately (and
politely!) communicate with all clients and always maintain an open
dialogue. This section covers Lab etiquette and offers tips on
successful communication.

#### How we edit

Clients submit their work using Google Drive, and we make all of our
edits directly in Drive documents. (Clients will post links to their
Drive documents in the GitHub issues they file.)

We have a practice of editing in **Suggesting mode**. Not only does
editing in Suggesting mode allow clients to easily see where you’ve made
changes (and what those changes are), but it also allows clients to
easily revert to the original version of a document. In short, it
reinforces the concept that we’re here to offer friendly feedback, but
we’re not insisting on implementing our views (at least, not in cases of
stylistic preference — we do enforce standard syntax, spelling, and
punctuation).

#### Best practices for editing

Here are a few additional suggestions for editing as effectively as
possible:

-   **Share compliments**: Making edits necessarily entails reworking or removing less-than-optimal text, but that doesn’t mean you should focus solely on what’s *not* working in a piece. Make note of sentences or sections that work especially well — the author will appreciate your balanced approach (and you’ll also be providing good concrete examples of successful content, which the author can use as references in the future).
-   **Don’t make assumptions**: As you’re editing, don’t make assumptions about information the author has included in the piece (or omitted from it); the author might be working under legal or regulatory constraints that you don’t know about. Rather than leaving confrontational comments (“Why didn’t you do X?”), frame your inquiries in a more open-minded and investigative way (“You may already have thought of this — and if you have, disregard this comment, but have you considered doing X?”)
-   **Share your context**: Sharing with the client what you were thinking as you read the piece provides insight into how the piece might impact other readers. Most folks prefer leaving margin comments, but it’s totally fine to leave a longer, more comprehensive critique at the end of the piece. If you’re making an edit that you think may be sensitive or controversial, leave a comment on your edit that explains your reasoning.
