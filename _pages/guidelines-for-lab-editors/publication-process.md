title: The publication process
---

The Writing Lab isn’t responsible for publishing content; each group
within 18F has its own processes for reviewing, publishing, and
maintaining written content. That said, Lab members can (and should)
definitely help authors navigate the publication process.

Recently, a small internal team created a tool — the **Content
Stakeholder Finder** — that everyone can use to determine who needs to
review or approve their work before they can publish it. The app asks
authors a series of questions to determine the type and nature of the
content to be published, and, based on these factors, provides a list of
approvers the author needs to contact.

The app lives here [link to Stakeholder Finder]. Check it out so you’re
familiar with how it works, and share the link with every author whose
work you edit. Though you should share this tool with clients, it’s not
your responsibility to seek out review or approval for a piece of
content. That’s left to the author.

Finally, the app is a work in progress. Send feedback and feature
requests to Andrew Maier, or discuss them at **Content Guild** meetings,
held every Wednesday at 1:30 PT/4:30 ET. (If you’re not on the invite
already, pop into #g-content and ask to be added!)
