Last but not least, here’s all the information you need about
Lab-related billing, time tracking, and resourcing.

**Time allocation**: Participating in the Lab is completely voluntary,
and you’re expected to prioritize client work and high-priority internal
work before taking on Lab tasks. If you find that, at a given point,
you’re too busy to help with the Lab, that’s totally fine — send Kate
and Andre a quick note, and start claiming tasks once your schedule
settles down.

**Billing:** Tasks associated with billable projects are billed to those
projects (you can ask the requester for the right Tock category if they
didn’t provide it); tasks **not** associated with billable projects are
billed to Writing Lab (248). If you have questions, ask them in
\#writing-lab or contact Andre or Kate.
