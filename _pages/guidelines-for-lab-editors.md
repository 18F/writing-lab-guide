title: Guidelines for Lab editors
---

The Lab workflow is fairly straightforward. Here’s how the process
works:

1.  A client with a writing- or editing-related request contacts us. They may file an issue in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/18F/writing-lab), or they may contact us in our Slack channel. If they contact us via Slack, someone from the Lab (that’s you!) will create an issue on their behalf.

2.  Each GitHub issue contains all the information you need to get started on a task. Our README includes a template clients can use to provide us with all the necessary information.

3.  Once a client has filed an issue, you or another Lab member can claim it (that is, assign it to yourself). After claiming an issue, you’ll complete the requested work within the stated timeframe and will communicate with the client throughout the process — asking for more details about the intended audience or desired tone, for example.

4.  When you’ve completed a task, you’ll follow up with the client to find out whether any additional work needs to be done. If not, you’ll close the issue. If additional work remains, comment on the issue and describe the additional request (this will help us become better at predicting the scope of requests). Once you’ve completed the additional work, you can follow the workflow as outlined above.

The process around closing issues is also fairly straightforward. As
described above, once you’ve finished a task, contact the client and ask
if it’s OK for you to close the issue — in almost all cases, the
requester will tell you to go ahead and close. If you don’t receive a
response from the requester within two days, reach out to them again. If
you still haven’t heard from the requester within a week of initially
completing the task, close the issue, noting in your comment that the
requester can re-open the issue if they need additional work.

Following the above workflow will help keep our repo tidy, and will also
help us get a better sense of how long different tasks take to complete.
